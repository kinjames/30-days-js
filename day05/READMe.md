This folder contains questions and answers on arrays. The questions are from Asabeneh's 30 Days of JavaScript. 

I learnt how to import files from one JavaScript file to the other using the export and import module. 

I learnt how to use most of the Math methods and string methods alongside array methods to manipulate arrays.
