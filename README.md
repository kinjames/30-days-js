I will be learning React, node.js and expressjs alongside mongo db 

I started react today, I,m using resources from net ninja's youtube channel and also using js mastery's resources for real life react projects.

I ws also able to finish the basics of javascript again, learnt new tricks since I used three different materials from different tutors to learn the basics.Each teacher had a new trick up on his sleeve to share.

I learnt most of the string methods, math methods, array properties and array methods.

I will continue to loops and functions tomorrow and hopefully finish objects too.
